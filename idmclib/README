Documentation for the idmclib C library
Last modified: 30/09/2008 by Antonio, Fabio Di Narzo

1. Compiling
For compiling idmclib you need a C99 compiler and the CMake (version >=2.4.6) build system.

From the top project directory, type:
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..
for configuring. If all goes right, type:
# make
to build all. Finally,
# make install
to install.

1.1 Dependencies
GLS-1.9 and LUA-5.1 (or compatibles) are required for compiling/linking the idmclib library.
SWIG-1.3, together with JDK-6 and Tcl-8.4 (or compatibles) are
required for building the Java and the TCL bindings, respectively.

1.2 Configuration
For fine-tuning compiling/linking flags, use CMake facilities.
Under unixes, the 'ccmake' command lets you set all building variables 
(such as paths to external libraries/programs) from an ncurses UI.

2. API
Look at the doc subfolder for documentation, and at the test directory for further usage examples.

3. Python bindings
Low-level python bindings were provided via SWIG, but are no longer mantained.
These are mainly intended for testing/prototyping purposes.
Watch at the pydmcTest.py file for usage examples, and to the various idmc_*.i interface files for the API.
If you wish, you will have to manually build it.

4. Java bindings
Java bindings are provided via SWIG. They're low-level, so maybe you'll need to write your own high-level wrappers for using in your project.
Watch at the SWIG interface files and to generated java files for the API. A full usage example is the companion iDMC software (2.x.x series).

5. TCL bindings
TCL bindings are provided via SWIG. They're low-level, and reflect the
C API very closely. So, the C API reference is a good reference for the
TCL API too. Look at the SWIG interface files, for details.
Look at the testing scripts in the tcl subfolder for some usage
examples.

5. R bindings
R bindings are provided via a regular R package, RiDMC, with bounded documentation.
It is distributed separately on the idmclib web site.

APPENDIX A. Step-by-step windows compiling instructions (idmclib + java bindings)
- Install JDK-1.6 (if you don't already have it)
- Download and unpack swig-1.3 (www.swig.org). Add the folder to the system path.
- Install MinGW, with the C compiler
- Install MSYS (with GNU make)
- Install CMake-2.4.6
- Download and compile under MinGW/MSYS the LUA-5.1 and GSL-1.9 packages 
  (maybe you can find ready-compiled libraries from the idmclib home page).
- Copy generated static libraries files (i.e.: liblua.a, liblualib.a, libgsl.a, libgslcblas.a) to the 'c:\mingw\lib' folder
- Unpack idmclib package somewhere. From the MSYS prompt, type:
	# mkdir build
	# cd build
	# cmake ..
	# make
- In case of troubles, try using the cmake GUI from the windows start
  menu. That will let you to fine tune paths.
